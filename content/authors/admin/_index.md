I am a PhD candidate in the marketing area at the Indian School of Business. I am on the academic job market. I am an empirical marketing scientist; in my research, I investigate the role of marketing strategies and regulatory policies on consumers and firms. My current research has an underlying theme of how the decision by peers or actions on peers influences the decisions of the focal agent. I have been fortunate enough to convince large firms to provide their proprietary data for my research projects.
