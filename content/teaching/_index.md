### Full Course 

These are 20 hour credit courses. Students in various degree of specilization are introduced to mathematics, statistics and programming required to understand various subjects.  For example in Math for Machine Learning course, I cover topics in linear algebra and matrix calculus. This is done to show how alogorithms in ML work and how can new alogirthms be created based on requirements.

- Math Bootcamp for PhD
- Proability and Statistics for PGP (MBA)
- Math and Statistics Starter for Executive PhD

### Tutorials 
These are 2-4 hour sessions to cover "how-to" for courses. For example, in supervised learning course, I show how to use various algorithms such as SVM, Random Forest, Elastic Net etc. I also contrast algorithms by when to use, their limitations, underlying math and computational complexity.
